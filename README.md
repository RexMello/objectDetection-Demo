Here's how you run it.

- Required python version 3.9.
- (Optional) If you have an nVIDIA GPU that supports CUDA, install pytorch first from https://pytorch.org/
- Install requirements.txt (In the same folder open cmd and run pip install -r requirements.txt)
- Run main.py (Still in same folder run python main.py).
